# WLHelper

WLHelper it is simple **command-line** script, which bases on WeLeakInfo.to API.
Helps you for mass search very most email address or phone numbers.
If you looks a mistake while using my script please add issue on github i will repair this.

Btw WeLeakInfo API sucks, so only works if type is an email. Also you can search by nickname or phone number but no change the type. You must set type as email.

# Changelog

Version 1.1
- Added posibility view services and passwords from which leaked data.

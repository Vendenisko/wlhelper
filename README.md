# WLHelper

WLHelper it is simple **command-line** script, which bases on WeLeakInfo.to and LeakCheck.net API.
Helps you for mass search email address or phone numbers.
If you find a mistake while using my script please add issue on github i will repair this.

**Btw WeLeakInfo API sucks, so only works if type is an email. Also you can search by nickname or phone number but no change the type.**
